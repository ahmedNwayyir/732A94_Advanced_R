Link√∂ping University, 1st semester 2019

## Intended learning outcomes


- write R programs based on programming techniques such as reading data from file or 
Internet, assignment and manipulation of data structures, defining own functions, 
iterations, conditional (if-then-else) statements and debugging,
- speed up R programs by using parallel programming and performance enhancement tools,
- organize the own code in the form of an R package.


## Course content

The course introduces general programming techniques and their practical implementation in the R language.

More specifically, the course includes:

- reading data from file, from the internet, and printing to output,
- data structures, functions and objects,
- iteration and conditional statements,
- numerical linear algebra in R,
- debugging,
- object-oriented programming,
- performance enhancement,
- parallel programming,
- literate programming,
- development of R packages.
